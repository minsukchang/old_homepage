In a nutshell, I've been actively thinking about the two major bridges between HCI systems research and ML/AI research that haven't been explored. (In no specific order) 

First is building computational interaction techniques  hat are powered by ML technologies. Researches in this area goes both ways, as in building novel interfaces and interactions using models from cognitive science and ML algorithms, AND understanding (or reverse engineering) computational user models from collected behavioral data.

Second is data collection and evaluation of AI/ML systems. Data is so important in ML, and we know as HCI researchers that the interactions and interfaces heavily influence user behaviors, thus the data being "collected". This is literally a double-edged sword, because this means a) the existing datasets need re-examinations as they might not be true samples of how users behave (and one recurring example being thrown everywhere is that systems trained on one of these data creating all sorts of problems like racial, gender discrimination, etc., there are many other examples) b) we can deliberately implement interactions and interfaces to collect the type of data we want and need - this can be very useful for building ML/AI systems.

Also, evaluation of ML systems (I use the term "systems" as a concept larger than algorithms) cannot be done without users, and there are takeaways and insights that potentially influence the design of inner workings, namely the ML algorithms. Distilling user insights into chunks of ideas that drive algorithm development is something we should thrive for.
