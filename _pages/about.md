Hi :) I am joining the [PAIR (People and AI Research) team](https://pair.withgoogle.com/) at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) as a research scientist in a few weeks. In my research, I explore novel computational interaction techniques powered by AI technologies by designing, building, and evaluating AI powered systems with users in the loop. I am also an adjunct professor at the [KAIST Graduate School of AI](http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr). 

These days, I am interested in 1) making [large-scale language models]() usable and useful, and 2) [simulation-based models]() of users and interfaces.

I have a PhD in Computer Science from [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"}. During my PhD, I was advised by [Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com){:target="\_blank"} in the [KIXLAB](http://kixlab.org){:target="\_blank"}. Before joining Google, I was a research scientist and a technical leader at [Naver AI](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab).

<!-- In the past,
I studied Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST. I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab). -->

<!-- I taught lab sessions for the mandatory Introduction to Programming course at KAIST from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
