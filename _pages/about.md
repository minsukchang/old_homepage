Hi :) I am a research scientist and a technical leader at [NAVER AI Lab](), where I explore novel computational interaction techniques powered by AI technologies. I build and evaluating AI powered systems with users in the loop. I am also an adjunct professor at the [KAIST Graduate School of AI](http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr).

My current research interests are 1) making [massive scale language models]() usable and useful, 2) [simulation-based models]() of users and interfaces. 

I have a PhD in Computer Science from [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"}. During my PhD, I was advised by [Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com){:target="\_blank"} in the [KIXLAB](http://kixlab.org){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- In the past,
I studied Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST. I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab). -->

<!-- I taught lab sessions for the mandatory Introduction to Programming course at KAIST from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester. -->
